# Forge Next Mission

## Resume point after MIRROR_RESUME_01

Status: Mirror projection, Session projection and deterministic Claude Mirror Resume complete and live verified.

## Verified baseline

1. The canonical runtime serves one listener on port 5000 from `artifacts/api-server/dist/index.mjs`.
2. Root and health are HTTP 200; database and storage are healthy.
3. Mirror list and detail endpoints are read-only, deterministic and restart-safe.
4. `GET /api/mirror/session/:missionId` derives one stable SessionModel from the existing mission projection without persistence or write authority.
5. `GET /api/mirror/resume` returns either one deterministic resume state, no result, or an explicit ambiguity response with at most five candidates; explicit missionId remains authoritative.
6. Forge Control exposes `Verdergaan` with read-only mission and timeline navigation, status, progress, blockers, advice, confidence and integrity warnings.
7. Runtime JSON stores remain authoritative; Mirror, Session and Resume have no persistence, write endpoint or execution action.
8. Runtime 55/55, frontend 16/16, Resume 12/12, Mirror 12/12, typechecks, builds and live browser/API validation are green.

## Next action

Use the deterministic Resume response when the operator asks to continue, then require an explicit missionId when the response is ambiguous. Select the next approved roadmap mission only after that read-only choice.

## Failure rules

- Preserve `missionId` as the primary cross-store correlation key.
- Keep SessionModel a deterministic projection; never add a Session store or parallel status truth.
- Keep ResumeModel read-only and derived; never persist candidate choice or infer state from chat text alone.
- Do not introduce a parallel mission, approval, audit, artifact or memory truth.
- Provider failure remains isolated and must not trigger automatic retry.
- No destructive operations, protected-path changes or history rewrite.
