## Repository

- Local path at recovery time: `C:\Forge\forge-core` (informational only; code must use repository-relative paths).
- Remote: `https://github.com/vinkrene-jpg/forge-core.git`.
- Reconstruction branch: `reconstruct/forge-core-v1`.
- Protected baseline tag: `pre-reconstruction-2026-07-12`.
- Baseline commit: `d7f5768`.
- Latest provider execution used source commit: `826bf273eb908218ff50c1478ce7ed0757ebcc21`.
- Current HEAD must be read from Git at session start; it is not inferred here.

## Live-verified components

| Component | Verified result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime persistence | Identity, counters and unclean-stop recovery persist | `RUNTIME_PERSISTENCE_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Mission Engine / MissionLoop | Persistent single-mission execution and restart recovery | `MISSION_ENGINE_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Governance Engine | Risk policy, blocking, approval, rejection and restart persistence | `GOVERNANCE_ENGINE_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Capability system | Registry, precheck, gap analysis and evolution planning | `CAPABILITY_EVOLUTION_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Evolution execution | Approval, automated verification, evidence and safe promotion | `EVOLUTION_ENGINE_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Forge Desktop | Live authoritative APIs, actions and SPA serving without demo state | `DESKTOP_BINDING_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Operator Core | Project Memory, protected workspace reading, grounded prompts and routing | `OPERATOR_CORE_VERIFICATION.json` |
| AI Gateway | Persistent, provider-independent controlled execution and secret isolation | `AI_GATEWAY_VERIFICATION.json` |
| Real provider execution | OpenAI Responses call succeeded; 886 input, 955 output, 1,841 total tokens; secret not persisted | `AI_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_VERIFICATION.json` |

## Provider verification correction

Older reconstruction text states that provider execution was unavailable until credentials were configured. That statement became stale after the successful execution at `2026-07-12T19:16:54+02:00` using provider `openai-responses` and model `gpt-5.6`.

## Not yet proven

- The complete autonomous loop from mission selection through real provider execution, evaluation, learning and automatic next-mission scheduling.
- Multiple consecutive autonomous provider-backed iterations visible in Forge Desktop.
- A canonical Learning Engine.
- A canonical Evaluator integrated into the live mission acceptance path.
- A recovered dedicated Kernel implementation matching the original historical design.
- Canonical Blueprint and Element Libraries.

## Current constraint

Do not add unrelated engines merely because they appear in the end architecture. The current priority is to integrate and prove the existing components as one closed loop. Inspect the repository first to determine whether any part of that integration already exists.
